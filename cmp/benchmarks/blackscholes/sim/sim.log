sim-outorder: This simulator implements a very detailed out-of-order issue
superscalar processor with a two-level memory system and speculative
execution support.  This simulator is a performance simulator, tracking the
latency of all pipeline operations.

  Pipetrace range arguments are formatted as follows:

    {{@|#}<start>}:{{@|#|+}<end>}

  Both ends of the range are optional, if neither are specified, the entire
  execution is traced.  Ranges that start with a `@' designate an address
  range to be traced, those that start with an `#' designate a cycle count
  range.  All other range values represent an instruction count range.  The
  second argument, if specified with a `+', indicates a value relative
  to the first argument, e.g., 1000:+100 == 1000:1100.  Program symbols may
  be used in all contexts.

    Examples:   -ptrace FOO.trc #0:#1000
                -ptrace BAR.trc @2000:
                -ptrace BLAH.trc :1500
                -ptrace UXXE.trc :
                -ptrace FOOBAR.trc @main:+278

  Branch predictor configuration examples for 2-level predictor:
    Configurations:   N, M, W, X
      N   # entries in first level (# of shift register(s))
      W   width of shift register(s)
      M   # entries in 2nd level (# of counters, or other FSM)
      X   (yes-1/no-0) xor history and address for 2nd level index
    Sample predictors:
      GAg     : 1, W, 2^W, 0
      GAp     : 1, W, M (M > 2^W), 0
      PAg     : N, W, 2^W, 0
      PAp     : N, W, M (M == 2^(N+W)), 0
      gshare  : 1, W, 2^W, 1
  Predictor `comb' combines a bimodal and a 2-level predictor.

  The cache config parameter <config> has the following format:

    <name>:<nsets>:<bsize>:<assoc>:<repl>

    <name>   - name of the cache being defined
    <nsets>  - number of sets in the cache
    <bsize>  - block size of the cache
    <assoc>  - associativity of the cache
    <repl>   - block replacement strategy, 'l'-LRU, 'f'-FIFO, 'r'-random

    Examples:   -cache:dl1 dl1:4096:32:1:l
                -dtlb dtlb:128:4096:32:r

  Cache levels can be unified by pointing a level of the instruction cache
  hierarchy at the data cache hiearchy using the "dl1" and "dl2" cache
  configuration arguments.  Most sensible combinations are supported, e.g.,

    A unified l2 cache (il2 is pointed at dl2):
      -cache:il1 il1:128:64:1:l -cache:il2 dl2
      -cache:dl1 dl1:256:32:1:l -cache:dl2 ul2:1024:64:2:l

    Or, a fully unified cache hierarchy (il1 pointed at dl1):
      -cache:il1 dl1
      -cache:dl1 ul1:256:32:1:l -cache:dl2 ul2:1024:64:2:l
